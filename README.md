## VEGAStools

This R package allows basic manipulations and displays of gene lists produced by the VEGAS software for [VErsatile Gene-base 
Association Studies](http://gump.qimr.edu.au/VEGAS/) as decribed by [Liu et al. 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929710003125). 

## Getting started

To install `VEGAStools` from github, you need the devtools package in your R environment. If you have not done so yet, start a fresh R session and run
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
This will install the developer tools and their dependencies. Now you can easily install `VEGAStools` via
```
devtools::install_github("alexploner/VEGAStools")
```
and you are good to go.
