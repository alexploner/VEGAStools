\usage{
counts(x, y, co = 0.05)

plotCounts(x, y, minP = 1e-06, maxP = 0.1, nP = 100, legend = TRUE,
  ylim, title, xlab, ylab, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x,y}{Two gene lists of class \code{VEGAS}}

\item{co}{Cutoff for selecting statistically significant genes in both lists}

\item{minP,maxP}{Smallest and largest cutoff value for considering the
overlap in significant genes between lists}

\item{nP}{Number of intermediate points between \code{minP} and \code{maxP}}

\item{legend}{Logical flag indicating whether to add a legend to the plot}

\item{ylim,title,xlab,ylab,...}{Standard graphical prarameters for \code{plot}
                  to override the function defaults}
}
\value{
\code{counts} returns a named vector with four components: \code{Obs},
the number of genes observed to be statistically significant at the chosen
cutoff, \code{Exp}, the number of genes expected to be significant in both
lists under the assumption that the propoerty being statistically significant
is independent between the two lists, and \code{LCL} and \code{UCL}, the
respective lower and upper 95\% confidence limits.

\code{plotCounts} generates a plot of observed/expected counts as a
function of the specified cutoff range and returns invisibly a data frame
with the cutoffs (column \code{co}) and the corresponding output from
\code{counts}.
}
\description{
Given two gene lists of class \code{VEGAS} and a p-value threshold, this
function reports the number of genes below this threshold on both lists,
together with the expected counts under the null hypothesis of no association
between the gene lists, and a 95\% confidence interval
